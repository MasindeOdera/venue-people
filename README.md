## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Start the JSON Server
```
json-server --watch db.json
```

### If you have issues with that:
```
npm install -g json-server
```

This is a slimmed down replica of a Frontend view used, not a finished version due to time constraints.
Don't forget to start the JSON Server after npm run serve.
